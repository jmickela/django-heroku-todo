## Basic Todo app

This is a very basic Todo app made with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), and hosted on Heroku. It serves as a simple example of hosting a Django site on Heroku, and making use of DRF to provide a generic REST interface. I will also implement a few different front ends to this site to create a Rosetta stone like example of how different front end technologies consume the exact same back end API.

####Roadmap
* ~~Basic REST Server~~
* ~~Add Heroku-specific information~~
* Make use of authentication header token to authenticate requests
* Token Based Authentication
* Basic Ember front end
* implement account creation though REST API
* Android front end
* Basic AngularJS front end
